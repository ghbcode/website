### Who am I? 
I am a father and a working professional with a Master's degree in Financial Engineering. My professional career has included work in consulting, prime brokerage and the hedge fund industries. My interests are varied although they often lie in the areas of Math and Science. When I'm not working or taking care of my kids, I work on many projects including lots of home improvement, building things (like workbenches and tree houses), some carpentry, 3D printing, some welding and the occasional arduino/pi project. I have always been and will remain to be an avid student and these pages are meant to keep track of important topics. There will surely be many changes along the way...

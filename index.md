### Who am I? 
I am a father and a working professional earning my Master's degree in Financial Engineering from USC. My interests are varied although they mostly lie in the areas of Math and Science. When I'm not sitting down and on my computer I work on many things including lots of home repair, 3D printing, welding, carpentry and some arduino yun projects. I have always been and will remain to be an avid student and these pages are meant to keep track of important topics. This is a work in progress so there will surely be changes along the way.

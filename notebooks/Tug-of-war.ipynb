    "You have two players playing tug of war. One to the left of the origin and the other on the right. The rules are:\n",
    "* game starts when player 0 pulls the rope and from then on the players take turns\n",
    "* the game ends when the rope crosses the -.5 mark (left player wins) or the .5 mark (right player wins)\n",
    "* the amount of length that the rope moves is determined by a RV sampled from a [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution) [0,1]\n",
    "* calculate the fair starting point\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key take aways\n",
    "\n",
    "* note how the game favors the player that tugs first\n",
    "* that is why the fair starting point is not at 0!\n",
    "* recall the properties of the uniform distribution, i.e. that the mean is 1/2\n",
    "  * so there is a 1/2 chance that the first player wins with the second player not having even the chance to tug at all\n",
    "* turns out that the fair starting point appears to be between -.3 and -.25"

    "# Options\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many sites with tutorials and tools for option exploration. [Option Strat](https://optionstrat.com/tutorials/options-builder) is full of good info. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Call\n",
    "* The right to buy underlying\n",
    "* $C = max(S-K, 0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Put\n",
    "* The right to sell the underlying\n",
    "* $P = max(K-S, 0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Put Call Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "Put-call parity defines the relationship between calls, puts and the underlying futures contract. \n",
    "\n",
    "$C + Ke^{-rT} = P + S_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "* C = Call premium\n",
    "* P = Put premium\n",
    "* S_0 = price of underlying\n",
    "* $Ke^{-rT}$ is the present value of Strike\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the formula above is the parity equition at time 0. At time T (expiration) that parity equation becomes \n",
    "$ max(S_T - K, 0) - K = max(K - S_T, 0) - S_T$. Ultimately you can manipulate the formula so that the LHS can be the target exposure while the RHS can be the synthetic implementation of that desired exposure. For example, if you wanted to short/sell the underlying sythetically you would buy a put, sell a call and borrow K. Note that $Ke^{-rT}$ means to lend K discounted back to today time 0. At time T you will be paid back K. So the negative of that is to borrow. \n",
    "\n",
    "$-S_0 = P - C - Ke^{-rT}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Valuation\n",
    "Note that the call option formula below only makes sense when S > K, i.e. in the money. Otherwise, the call option is at/out the the money and its value is 0. You can think of an option as having `intrinsic` and `extrinsic (time)` value. For a call option `intrinsic` value is simply $max(S_t - K_t, 0)$, i.e. how much is the call option worth at this particular moment, t. `Extrinsic` value is the call premium minus the intrinsic value and it is governed by the parameters t and implied volatility. Note that at and out of the money options consist only of extrinsic value. \n",
    "\n",
    "$ C = S N(d_1) - Ke^{-rt}N(d2)$ where\n",
    "\n",
    "$ d_1 = \\frac{ln(\\frac{S}{K}) + rt + \\frac{\\sigma^2t}{2}}{\\sigma \\sqrt{t}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get into the nitty gritty but it boils down to the following:\n",
    "* $N(d_1)$ is a cummulative standard normal probability that says \"if the call expires in the money, then how far into the money the stock price will be\"\n",
    "* $N(d_2)$ is the probability that the stock will end up in the money \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the call option value becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "C = (Price of stock x probability of how far into the money stock expires) - (time value of strike price x probability stock will end up at or higher than strike at expiration)\n",

    "## The Greeks\n",
    "\n",
    "The greeks are used to assess how different parameters change option pricing. They are partial derivatives wrt to a certain factor. So for example, $\\delta_{call} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S}$\n",

    "### Delta - $\\delta$\n",
    "Measures and option's price sensitivty wrt a change in the underlying's price. Think 'speed'.\n",
    "- for call [0,1]\n",
    "- for put [-1,0]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gamma - $\\gamma$\n",
    "Measures and Delta's sensitivty wrt a change in the underlying's price. It is the rate of change in Delta or the second partial derivative wrt to underlying price. Think 'acceleration'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theta - $\\theta$\n",
    "Measures and option's price sensitivty wrt a change in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vega\n",
    "Measures and option's price sensitivty wrt a change in the implied volatility\n",
    "* Note that implied volatility is almost always higher than realized volatility because in its calculation extreme events are included. Since most likely an extreme event is not present during realized volatily then realized vol will be lower (usually)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rho - $\\rho$\n",
    "Measures and option's price sensitivty wrt a change in the interest rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Side notes\n",
    "* Why are puts more costly than calls? \n",
    "  * from a behavioral perspective people are willing to pay more for downside protection and in fact do so. \n",
    "* As a general rule, an option will lose one-third of its value during the first half of its life and two-thirds during the second half of its life. The closer the option gets to expiration, the more of a move in the underlying security is needed to impact the price of the option.\n",

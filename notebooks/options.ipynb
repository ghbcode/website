    "# Options\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many sites with tutorials and tools for option exploration. [Option Strat](https://optionstrat.com/tutorials/options-builder) is full of good info, just click on the `Build` drop down and you get a nicely laid out menu.  \n",

    "* The right to buy underlying\n",
    "* $C = max(S-K, 0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Put\n",

    "## Put Call Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "Put-call parity defines the relationship between calls, puts and the underlying futures contract. \n",
    "\n",
    "$C + Ke^{-rT} = P + S_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "* C = Call premium\n",
    "* P = Put premium\n",
    "* S_0 = price of underlying\n",
    "* $Ke^{-rT}$ is the present value of Strike\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the formula above is the parity equition at time 0. At time T (expiration) that parity equation becomes \n",
    "$ max(S_T - K, 0) - K = max(K - S_T, 0) - S_T$. Ultimately you can manipulate the formula so that the LHS can be the target exposure while the RHS can be the synthetic implementation of that desired exposure. For example, if you wanted to short/sell the underlying sythetically you would buy a put, sell a call and borrow K. Note that $Ke^{-rT}$ means to lend K discounted back to today time 0. At time T you will be paid back K. So the negative of that is to borrow. \n",

    "## Valuation/Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three major ways to price or value an option. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Binomial Pricing Model\n",
    "The [Binomial Pricing Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_options_pricing_model) is a numerical method that allows you to handle a variety of conditions since it builds a lattice of prices at each discrete time increment. Leaving aside many details this model basically does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate a tree of prices for $n$ time steps\n",
    "  * starting at t=0, giving probabilities of an up/down move (need to add to 1), assign a price to the underlying given an up/down move in each time increment. \n",
    "  * note that at the end you have $2^n$ terminal option prices. \n",
    "  * In comp sci this is $O(n^2)$ run time\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate option values/prices at each final node\n",
    "  * Using the following formulas, calculate terminal option prices: \n",
    "    * $Call = max(S-K, 0)$, \n",
    "    * $Put = max(K-S, 0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate option values/prices starting with the terminal (t) values and moving backward\n",
    "  * the value of (call) option at t-1 is simply $p_{up,t-1}C_{up,t} + p_{down,t-1}C_{down,t}$\n",
    "  * where $p_{up,t-1}$ is the probability that stock price goes up at $t-1$ and $C_{up,t}$ is the final Call value at t due to a move up from the previous node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Pricing Model\n",
    "Also a numerical method for pricing/valuing options, the [Monte Carlo Pricing Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_methods_for_option_pricing) allows for more sources of uncertainty because the simulation engine allows to simulate various sources/variables that get combined to produce a final value. Additionally, MC simulation allows you to generate a latice of price paths that are pseudo random and not as simplistic as $p_{up}$ or $p_{down}$ as in the Binomial model. The simulation engine can use any kind of probability distribution for its output variables and that is another way that MC allows for more realistic results. Very broadly speaking these are the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* generate large number of price paths for underlying\n",
    "* calculate option payoff values at each step in the paths above (i.e. as if option is exercised at that step)\n",
    "* average each path\n",
    "* discount to $t=0$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Black Scholes Pricing Model\n",
    "Note that the call option formula below only makes sense when S > K, i.e. in the money. Otherwise, the call option is at/out the the money and its value is 0. You can think of an option as having `intrinsic` and `extrinsic (time)` value. For a call option `intrinsic` value is simply $max(S_t - K_t, 0)$, i.e. how much is the call option worth at this particular moment in time, t. `Extrinsic` value is the call premium minus the intrinsic value and it is governed by the parameters t and implied volatility. Note that, ATM and OTM options consist only of extrinsic/time value. \n",
    "\n",
    "$ C = S N(d_1) - Ke^{-rt}N(d2)$ where\n",
    "\n",
    "$ d_1 = \\frac{ln(\\frac{S}{K}) + rt + \\frac{\\sigma^2t}{2}}{\\sigma \\sqrt{t}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get into the nitty gritty but it boils down to the following:\n",
    "* $N(d_1)$ is a cummulative standard normal probability that says \"if the call expires in the money, then how far into the money the stock price will be\"\n",
    "* $N(d_2)$ is the probability that the stock will end up in the money \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the call option value becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "C = (Price of stock x probability of how far into the money stock expires) - (time value of strike price x probability stock will end up at or higher than strike at expiration)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Greeks\n",
    "\n",
    "The greeks are used to assess how different parameters change option pricing. They are partial derivatives wrt to a certain factor. So for example, $\\delta_{call} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Delta - $\\delta$\n",
    "Measures and option's price sensitivty wrt a change in the underlying's price. Think 'speed'.\n",
    "- for call [0,1]\n",
    "- for put [-1,0]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gamma - $\\gamma$\n",
    "Measures and Delta's sensitivty wrt a change in the underlying's price. It is the rate of change in Delta or the second partial derivative wrt to underlying price. Think 'acceleration'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theta - $\\theta$\n",
    "Measures and option's price sensitivty wrt a change in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vega\n",
    "Measures and option's price sensitivty wrt a change in the implied volatility\n",
    "* Note that implied volatility is almost always higher than realized volatility because in its calculation extreme events are included. Since most likely an extreme event is not present during realized volatily then realized vol will be lower (usually)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rho - $\\rho$\n",
    "Measures and option's price sensitivty wrt a change in the interest rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Side notes\n",
    "* Why are puts more costly than calls? \n",
    "  * from a behavioral perspective people are willing to pay more for downside protection and in fact do so. \n",
    "* As a general rule, an option will lose one-third of its value during the first half of its life and two-thirds during the second half of its life. The closer the option gets to expiration, the more of a move in the underlying security is needed to impact the price of the option.\n",
